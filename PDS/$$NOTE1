Hi Sam,

I am the contributor of CBT 611 tape (REXX to submit job based on
RC fom previous job).  I had promised you more updates.

With all the help you extended, I was able to extend the
application to perform scheduling operation of any batch cycle. I
have tested it for a one batch cycle.

This tool is having the functionalities such as automating a
whole cycle, to restart at a particular job etc. README and HELP
files are also included.

I also want to thank my teammates, Madhan (for the design of
tables which the tool uses) and Mathangi(for GUI using panels).

I want to extend my sincere thanks to you for your constant help
and encouragement.

Thanking you,
Hari
