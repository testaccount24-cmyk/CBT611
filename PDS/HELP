                             JOB07


    For the sequence of jobs given above, the user entry to be done is given
    in Table I.



    The Terminology used are explained below:
    _________________________________________


    Trigger Job:  (Entered as type 'T')
    -----------   ---------------------

    Trigger job is a job which gets submitted immediately after the
    completion of the previous job without any dependencies on any
    other job. The first job in the cycle which triggers the rest of
    the jobs must also be defined as type 'T'.
    Example: JOB03 (as in Figure I) can be submitted immediately after
             JOB01 completes without waiting for any other Job.


    Dependent Job:  (Entered as type 'D')
    -------------   ---------------------

    Dependent job is a job which has to wait for more than one job to
    get finished before it can be submitted.
    Example: JOB06 (as in Figure I) has to wait till JOB04 and JOB05
             are completed successfully.


    Parent Job:
    -----------
    Refers to the Job which would call another job on its successful
    completion.

    Child Job:
    ----------
    Refers to the Job which must be called on the successful completion
    of the corresponding parent job.


    How to add jobs to Table I ?
    ****************************

    For the First job ie JOB01 the PARENT and CHILD jobs are to be entered
    as JOB01.

    JOB01 Triggers 2 jobs namely, JOB02 and JOB03.
    For this the entry should be

    Parent   Child  type
    JOB01    JOB02   T  --->> type is T(for Trigger)
    JOB01    JOB03   T  --->> type is T(for Trigger)

    JOB06 is a Dependent job. It depends on the successful completion of the
    jobs JOB04 and JOB05.

    For this the entry should be
    Parent   Child  type
    JOB04    JOB06   D  --->> type is D(for Dependent)
    JOB05    JOB06   D  --->> type is D(for Dependent)

    Once the entries are done properly, select PF3 to display the below
    panel:
       ____________________________________
      |                                    |
      |                                    |
      |                                    |
      |     Submit Scheduler JOB  _        |
      |                                    |
      |     Y for Submit, R for Restart    |
      |                                    |
      |                                    |
      |                                    |
      |                                    |
      |                                    |
      |____________________________________|

    On selection of 'Y' for Generate Master Tables, the system would
    generate all the required Master tables, which would be internally
    used for scheduling the jobs by the Scheduling routine.

    Selection of PF3 in this screen would quit the application.

    If the option selected is 'R', the following screen will be shown.

    How to start the automatic submission of Jobs ?
    ***********************************************

    If 'Y' is selected for Submit Scheduler Jobs, the scheduler would:

    1. Submit the Scheduling JCL.

    2. In case of abend, further submission of jobs will not take place and
       spool will show the abended job.

    3. If the jobs go through fine, spool will show that jobs are scheduled
       properly.

    4. In case of abend, corrective action can be taken and the scheduling
       JCL can be submitted with RESTART option with the job to be
       restarted. Then the scheduling will start from the restart job
       specified.
